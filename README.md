## Objective
The purpose of this application is to provide employees with a consolidated dashboard that consists of an interactive calendar where they can view their clock in and out times.

## How To Use
When starting the application, you'll be greeted by a login screen. If its your first time visiting the application, you'll have to create an account by clicking on the "Create Account" button.
From there, follow the instructions to create your username and password.
After creation, you will now be able to log in.

Once logged in, you'll see the employee dashboard.

At the top of the screen, the app will show you the current date and time.

1. The first step is to click on the `Calendar` button.
2. Once clicked, you'll be brought to a new screen showing a calendar, with today's date selected.
3. Choose the date you want to start clocking in for or to show the values that already exist.
4. Click the `OK` button to be brought back to the dashboard.
5. Now, click `Clock In` to clock in and start the timer which will show you how long you've been clocked in for.
6. When you're ready to clock out, click `Clock Out`, confirm your choice, and you'll see the total amount of time you were clocked in for display on the screen.

A `Delete` button also exists next to each entry that allows you to remove the entry if so desired.
